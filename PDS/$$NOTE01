Hi Sam,

Larry Zuckett, I formerly worked at Ford and submitted
the  USYNC commmand.  I have attached a System REXX routine to
dynamically update the LINKLIST that you may want to add to your
CBT tape. The use of it and how to use it is in the comments at
the beginning of the System Rexx routine. It's far easier to use
then using the individual SETPROG DEFINE, COPY, ADD, and activate
commands.

1) This is setup by adding a system rexx library to the
   concatenation in AXRnn  in PARMLIB:

REXXLIB ADD DSN(SYS2.SAXREXEC)   /* INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SYSREXX    */
REXXLIB ADD DSN(SYS1.SAXREXEC)   /* ADD REXXLIB.DSN1 INTO THE       */

2) Shutdown System Rexx:   F AXR,SHUTDOWN

3) Restart System Rexx:   S AXRPSTRT   (if not in PROCLIB,
   this can be copied from SYS1.IBM.PROCLIB)

4) Verify the library is in concatenation:   F AXR,SR,R

  F AXR,SR,R
  AXR0202I SYSREXX REXXLIB DISPLAY 702
  ENTRY VOLUME   DATA SET
     1    SYSTEM   SYS2.SAXREXEC
     2    MVZ25A   SYS1.SAXREXEC

5) Add or delete a LINKLIST library by entering the following:
F AXR,SWLNKLST,TIMEINT=1000 'DEL(old linklist library)'

F AXR,SWLNKLST,TIMEINT=1000 'ADD(new linklist  library)'

The use of this system rexx is in the comments on the rexx
   routine

I use this for dynamically doing product install maintenance and
   upgrades
